# PAYROLL-AND-EMPLOYEE-ATTENDANCE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Project Overview 
This system is a Payroll and Employee Attendance System designed to automate and simplify how an organization manages its workforce. 
It replaces manual tracking with a centralized software solution that records attendance, computes salaries, manages employee information, 
handles deductions, and supports administrative decisions through a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
It is built primarily using Python and utilizes Tkinter for the user interface and SQLite3 for persistent internal data storage. 
Key Features 

• Automated Payroll Computation: Calculates net pay based on attendance, absences, tardiness, overtime, and leaves. 

• Centralized Employee Records: Securely stores employee IDs, names, positions, salary rates, and departments. 

• Attendance Tracking: Records daily time-in and time-out used for payroll computation. 

• Deduction Management: Automatically handles mandatory government deductions (SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG, Tax) and applies deductions for loans, tardiness, and undertime. 
• Leave and Loan Management: Allows tracking and approval of employee leave requests and loan balances. 

• User-Friendly GUI: Provides an intuitive interface for staff and administrators (built with Tkinter).
